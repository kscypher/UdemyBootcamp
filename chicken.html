                Chicken
            </b>
            (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">
                fowl
            </a>
             They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
             Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl). Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, 
             and a younger male may be called a cockerel. <sup><a href="somesource.com"></a>[2]</sup> A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
             An adult female bird is called a hen, and a <sub>sexually </sub>immature female is called a pullet. 
             Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as 
             pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some 
             places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
             Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population 
             of 23.7 billion as of 2018,up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in 
             the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, 
             folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.</p>

                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, 
                Southeast Asia, and East Asia,but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, 
                and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread 
                to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with 
                the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, 
                Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. They are known in ancient Greece from 
                the 5th century BC.
